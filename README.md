There are company, vacancy and resume entities, most data is hardcoded for simplicity purposes. There are endpoints to list all companies, get company by id, list all vacancies, get vacancy by id (shows extended info about vacancy), show a resume. POST request currently don't do anything, they're just created for test purposes.
